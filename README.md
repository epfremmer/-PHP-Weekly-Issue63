Challenge 063: Holy cats! We need Tests!!!
==========================================

# Overview

We have made a small library to help us manage our cats. As a cat management service we want to add additional cat 
management capabilities to our library. The problem is that we were in such a rush to manage the cats that we had at the
time of writing the library that we didn't included any tests.

In order to ensure backwards cat-compatibility in the new version of our code, we are going to begin the next phase of
development by first writing tests so we avoid deploying breaking cat-changes to our existing cat service implementations.

# Challenge Goals

* Write tests for the existing codebase
* Refactor areas of the code that are difficult to test in a way that makes them easier to test
* Fork the repo and return your submissions as a pull-request
* __[Bonus points]__ Collect and achieve 100% code coverage for the library
* __[More points-ing]__ Integrate the refactored codebase with other services that measure library health/complexity
